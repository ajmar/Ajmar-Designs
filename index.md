I am a 17 year old student, currently attending Crossley Heath 6ᵗʰ Form where I study Computer Science, Photography, Psychology, and English Literature. Outside of school I enjoy tinkering with electronics, programming, experimenting with Photoshop & image manipulation, as well as shooting stills / photography. I shoot all my photos on a Panasonic DMC-G7 w/ 14-42mm lens & 10mm ext. tube for macro shots.

My site is currently being rewritten in Jekyll ('Minimal' theme), and currently very incomplete.
